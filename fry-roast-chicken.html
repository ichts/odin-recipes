    <h2>Description</h1>
    
    <p>This week, I wanted to teach you how to make a classic Cantonese dish, ‘fry-roast’ chicken.

Before we dive in though, let’s just discuss this name real quick. “Fry-roast” is my personal translation for this – the technique is called “jianju”, a combination of the character for pan-fry (jian, i.e. 煎) and roast/bake (ju, i.e. 焗). While that might be kind of evocative of the Western pan-roasting technique (and there are some similarities), for the most part nothing overly fancy’s going on here. The chicken pieces are pan-fried until golden brown, then you drop the heat a bit and cover the pan so things cook through evenly.

    <h2>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
